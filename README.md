# Introduction

This repository contains my projects of Udacity's Nanodegree 
[Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).

# Projects

### Project 1 
In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during
September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in 
the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

### Project 2
For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a 
variety of topics related to the **data structures** you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean
and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design
choices.

### Project 3
For this project, you will answer the seven questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a 
variety of topics related to the **basic algorithms** you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean 
and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design
choices.

### Project 4
In this project, you will build a **route-planning algorithm** like the one used in Google Maps to calculate 
the shortest path between two points on a map.


Refer to each project's `README.md` for further information.
