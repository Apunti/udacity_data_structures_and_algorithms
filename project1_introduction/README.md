# Project Description

In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during
September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in 
the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

The tasks are in the python files and the run time analysis in `Analysis.txt`.
