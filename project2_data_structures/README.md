# Project Description

For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a 
variety of topics related to the data structures you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean
and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design
choices.

# Problems

### Problem 1
For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. 

### Problem 2
For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories 
beneath it) that end with ".c"

### Problem 3
In general, a data compression algorithm reduces the amount of memory (bits) required to represent a message
(data). The compressed data, in turn, helps to reduce the transmission time from a sender to receiver. The 
sender encodes the data, and the receiver decodes the encoded data. As part of this problem, you have to 
implement the logic for both encoding and decoding based on the **Huffman Coding** algorithm.

### Problem 4
In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this 
hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

### Problem 5
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information
and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of
the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, 
the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

### Problem 6
Your task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and 
B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, 
denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or 
intersection, respectively. Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and 
perform your own run time analysis on the code.
