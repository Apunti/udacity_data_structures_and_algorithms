# Project Description
In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest 
path between two points on a map.

# Installation Guide

You will need the following packages:
- Plotly
- Networkx
- Jupyter

I would recommend to create a virtual environment and installing them via if you are working
with Linux (assuming you have python 3, pip and virtualenv installed, check [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) instead):

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
