# Project Description

For this project, you will answer the seven questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a 
variety of topics related to the basic algorithms you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean 
and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design
choices.

# Problems

### Problem 1
Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of
the square root.

### Problem 2
You are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point.

Example: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You can assume there are no duplicates in the array and your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the
order of O(log n).

### Problem 3
Rearrange Array Elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum. Return these two numbers. 
You can assume that all array elements are in the range [0, 9]. The number of digits in both the numbers 
cannot differ by more than 1. You're not allowed to use any sorting function that Python provides and the
expected time complexity is O(nlog(n)).

for e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The expected answer would be [531, 42]. Another expected answer can be [542, 31]. In scenarios such as these
when there are more than one possible answers, return any one.

### Problem 4
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal. You're not allowed 
to use any sorting function that Python provides.

### Problem 5
Autocomplete with Tries.

### Problem 6
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code 
should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.

### Problem 7
For this exercise we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using
the Trie data structure we learned previously.
