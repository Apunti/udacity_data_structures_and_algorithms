We assume the input list to be a list of integers.

Algorithm:

We iterate the values of the list, storing the max and min value
that have been seen so far. At the end, we will have the max and
min values of the list.

Time complexity:

We iterate over the list of n elements, so the time complexity is
linear, O(n).

Space complexity:

The auxiliary space is O(1) because we only use two variables, but
the space complexity is O(n), the length of the given list of ints.
