Algorithm:

The main idea of the algorithm is to go through the list element by
element, if 0 is found, put it on the first position, if a 2 is found
put it at the end of the list, and if 1 is found leave it there. This
way, we can sort it in a single traversal.

Moreover, we check if all the items in the input_list are either 0,1 or 2.


Time complexity:

We go through all the list, element by element, so the time complexity is
linear, O(n). The method insert and the method delete are also O(n), so
the algorithm is O(n).

Space complexity:

We use the list provided, so the time complexity is O(n), the auxiliary
space is O(1).

Data structure:

No data structure choice
